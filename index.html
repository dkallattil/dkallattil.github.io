        I'm a data scientist based in New York. I'm currently at January Advisors, working on 
        various projects related to environmental protection, access to justice, and improving K12 education. 

        Before that, I was in grad school at UT getting a degree in epidemiology. 
        I worked the medical school's Center for Health & Environment. 

        Before that, I did a year of AmeriCorps service at public middle school in Detroit. 
        I worked with 7th and 8th grade math students on arithmetic and fractions as we navigated the pandemic and virtual school. 

        Before that, I lasted a whole year as a software developer. 
        I worked with wonderful people and learned I wasn't cut out for fintech. 

        Before that, I studied Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill.
