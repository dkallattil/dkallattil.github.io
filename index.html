    <h2>I’m a Computer Science student minoring in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/" target="_blank" class="btn">UNC</a>. I have experience working on long term industry projects at <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html" target="_blank" class="btn">SAS</a> and soon, Capital One. I like modern design and writing clean, modular code. I’m passionate about social justice, environmental advocacy, and education. Away from the keyboard, I like to read, run, and play board games.</h2>
